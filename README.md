# CHIP-8 Emulator

Welcome to the **CHIP-8 Emulator** project! This emulator replicates the functionality of the CHIP-8 virtual machine, which was used in classic systems and is a popular starting point for emulator development. Below is a detailed explanation of the emulator, its capabilities, and how you can use it.

## About CHIP-8
CHIP-8 is a simple, interpreted virtual machine used to run small games from the 1970s. It features:
- A 64x32 monochrome display.
- A 16-key hexadecimal keypad.
- Simple instruction sets for drawing, input, and computation.

This emulator provides a modern implementation of CHIP-8 in Rust, suitable for learning and experimenting with low-level systems.

---

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following modules:
- **`cpu`**: The core logic for opcode decoding and execution.
- **`memory`**: Handles memory operations and fontset loading.
- **`display`**: Manages rendering and user interface.
- **`utils`**: Utility functions like random number generation.
- **`opcodes`**: Enum definitions for CHIP-8 instructions.

---

## Features

- **Instruction Set Implementation**: Supports all original CHIP-8 opcodes.
- **ROM Loading**: Load and execute `.ch8` ROM files.
- **Emulation Cycle**: Simulates the CPU cycle, including opcode fetch, decode, and execute.
- **Graphics Rendering**: Renders the 64x32 monochrome display.
- **Timers**: Implements delay and sound timers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your system.
- A CHIP-8 ROM file to test (e.g., `maze.ch8`).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chip8-emulator.git
   cd chip8-emulator
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

---

## Usage

### Running the Emulator
1. Place your ROM file in the `src/roms/` directory.
2. Start the emulator:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```
   This will load the default ROM (`maze.ch8`). You can modify the ROM path in the `main.rs` file.

### Controls
Use the following keys for input (mapped to a typical keyboard layout):

| CHIP-8 Key | Keyboard Key |
|------------|--------------|
| `1`        | `1`          |
| `2`        | `2`          |
| `3`        | `3`          |
| `C`        | `4`          |
| `4`        | `Q`          |
| `5`        | `W`          |
| `6`        | `E`          |
| `D`        | `R`          |
| `7`        | `A`          |
| `8`        | `S`          |
| `9`        | `D`          |
| `E`        | `F`          |
| `A`        | `Z`          |
| `0`        | `X`          |
| `B`        | `C`          |
| `F`        | `V`          |

## Development

### Key Files
- **`cpu.rs`**: Implements CHIP-8's CPU, including opcode execution.
- **`memory.rs`**: Handles memory management.
- **`display.rs`**: Implements graphical output.
- **`main.rs`**: Entry point of the application.

### Adding Features
1. To add support for additional opcodes, extend the `decode_opcode` and `execute` functions in `cpu.rs`.
2. For graphical improvements, modify the `display` module.

### Debugging
- Enable opcode logging by inspecting `println!` statements in `cycle` and `execute`.
